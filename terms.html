                <li><strong>Early Decision</strong> : Early Decision is binding which means if any student applies in Early Decision and gets accepted, he/she is obliged (compulsory) to attend that college. A student cannot apply to more than 1 college under an early decision plan. The deadline for Early Decision for most colleges is during November and you get the decision by December. If you plan to apply for Early Decision, College should be your first-choice college. Every college does not provide Early Decision plans, so you should check your college website to find it out.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Action</strong>:  Early Action is Non-binding which means students apply to the colleges Early(by the end of November ) and also get the decision Early(by December). It is similar to Early Decision; however, you can apply to as many colleges as you want in early action, unlike early decision which only allows applying to one college. . Every college does not provide Early Action plans, so you should check your college website to find it out.

                    We knew that Early Decision and Early Action have Early Deadlines. But what if you cannot apply Early? No worries, you have options for other admission plans!</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Decision</strong> : This is the most common type of decision students apply for. For this, you have to apply to colleges by deadlines and colleges usually have Regular Decision Deadlines in April. In Regular Decision, often termed as “RD”, you can apply to as many colleges as you want. The colleges wait for all students to apply by deadlines, evaluate the applications, and give you the decision. So, the decision for early decision requires a little extra time. If you cannot apply for Early Decision or Early Action, This plan can be the best for you. Almost Every college has Regular Decision plans.</li>   
                <li><strong>Rolling Admission</strong> :  With Rolling Admission, the deadline is the same as the regular decision deadline. The only difference is that colleges that offer rolling admissions do not wait till after the deadline to send out acceptance letters. They start evaluating the applications as they come in and send out letters as soon as they’ve made a decision. So, if you apply for Rolling Admission, you will get the decision in weeks.</li>

                <li><strong>Need-Based Scholarship : </strong>Need-based scholarships are offered based on your financial need. Unlike Merit Scholarship, Need-Based scholarship does not depend upon the SAT score or GPA. The college asks you the amount of scholarship you need, and if you get accepted, they provided you this scholarship. Every college does not provide Need-Based scholarships to International students and mostly, this scholarship is provided by private universities(Want to know about Public and private universities, look below) in the USA. As an international student, it is difficult to receive a Need-based scholarship as compared to Merit scholarships.</li>
